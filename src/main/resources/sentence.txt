Britain announced last year that it would cut aid spending from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%, amounting to a reduction of more than £4bn and triggering fury from five former prime ministers as well as a series of other politicians and experts. The cuts are to the UK’s Official Development Aid (ODA) budget, which is distributed by a number of Whitehall departments with a portion funding international research.

Whitehall has yet to confirm the full range of programmes affected, but it is clear that the axe is not falling evenly. Details of severe cuts to humanitarian aid in Yemen and Syria were followed by reductions in funding for polio research, clean water projects and girls’ education.
